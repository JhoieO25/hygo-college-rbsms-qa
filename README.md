# HyGo College RBSMS – QA & Full-Stack Project
End-to-end QA testing case study for the Hygo College Role Based School Management System (academic project).

## Overview

This repository documents the Quality Assurance work performed on a custom-built Role-Based School Management System (RBSMS) developed as part of my postgraduate project.

In this project, I acted as both:

- **Full-Stack Developer** – React (Vite), Spring Boot, MySQL  
- **Quality Assurance Engineer** – Requirements analysis, test design, execution, defect reporting, and test closure

The goal was to design, build, and test a production-style academic management system that supports administrators, teachers, and parents in managing attendance, grading,
communication, and academic reporting.

This repository focuses on the **QA lifecycle** and selected, sanitized artefacts that demonstrate real-world testing practices.

## System Summary

**System Name:** HyGo College RBSMS  
**Domain:** Education - School Management  
**Architecture:** Web-based role-based system  
**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- Backend: Spring Boot
- Database: MySQL

**Primary User Roles:**
- Administrator  
- Teacher  
- Parent  

## Scope of QA Work

The QA activities covered:

- Requirements analysis from user stories & acceptance criteria  
- Functional testing of core modules:
  - Authentication & role-based access
  - Attendance & geofenced clock-in
  - Grading & reporting
  - Messaging & communication
- Validation testing
- Negative & edge case testing
- Test documentation and reporting

Testing types performed:

- Functional Testing  
- Integration Testing  
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT – simulated)  
- Basic Security & Validation Testing  

## Key Highlights

- Designed and tested a complete role-based academic management system  
- Built both backend and frontend, then independently tested my own system  
- Produced full QA documentation lifecycle:
  - Test Plan  
  - Test Cases  
  - Bug Reports  
  - Test Summary & Closure  

This project demonstrates both **engineering depth** and **QA practice**.

## Disclaimer

This repository contains **curated and sanitized artefacts only**.  
Full academic documents, internal design details, and full test suites are not published to avoid oversharing and to keep the repository easy.
